# Semantic Versioning Specification

"Semantic Versioning" or "SemVer" contain a set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. You can find full document in [semver.md](./semver.md) or visit our official website [semver.org](https://semver.org) to find previous versions and localized specifications.

# Building SemVer SVG
To build the current semver.svg, we currently use https://www.regexplained.co.uk/ to build the svg.
